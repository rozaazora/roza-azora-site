If the user activates a call link she will receive a confirmation alert asking whether to place the call, showing the full number. This is to avoid frauds tricking the user into calling another country or a premium number.

I recommend inserting the phone number in the international format: the plus sign (\+), the country code, the local area code, and the local number. We do not really know where our visitors will be located. If they are in the same country, or even in the same local area, the international format will still work.
